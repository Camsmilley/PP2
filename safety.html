            <h1 class="display-4">10 Tips for Surfing Safely at the Beginner Level</h1>
          </div>
          <hr>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-break">Surfing is now more popular than ever. Many of you will be taking to the waves for the first time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-break">You’ve got your surfboard and you hit the waves.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-break">However, unless you have some basic surf safety knowledge, it’s easy to get in over your head.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-break">Here are 10 tips to help you surf safely and ensure you have fun at the same time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">1.Knowledge of the Ocean.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">As simple as it sounds, the ocean and waves can be unpredictable at the best of times. Knowing about the
                different types of waves and how waves break will help you determine what waves to catch and 
                which ones to stay away from.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">2. Don’t be Washed Away.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">Rips and currents are one of the major hazards for inexperienced surfers. They can carry you far out to sea 
                or into large breaking waves. Make sure you can identify where rips and currents are and stay away from them. 
                Patrolled beaches usually have signs on the beach identifying where the rips and currents are. Look out for them.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">3. Learn the Surf Lingo. </h5>
            <p class="text-break">Surfing has a language all of its own. Experienced surfers use not only surfing terms, but also shouts and signals
                 when out in the water. If you are out paddling in the water and you here a shout or whistle, it is probably an 
                 experienced surfer surfing on a wave and heading towards you. It means “watch out, I’m coming through”.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">4. Have Surfing Awareness. </h5>
            <p class="text-break">Don’t be a UFO – an “Unidentified Floating Object”. This is the term commonly used by experienced surfers for surfers
                  who have little surfing awareness. When out in the water, be constantly aware of all that is happening around you to ensure you are not
                  an obstacle to other surfers and swimmers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">5. Understand Surfing Rules.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">Just like any other sport, surfing has rules to ensure surfing is safe. The one major rule in surfing is the rule of “dropping in”.
                 This is where you drop in on a wave another surfer has priority on. Make sure you understand who has priority on 
                 the wave so you do not take someone else’s wave.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">6. Don’t Over Do It.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">Surfing requires a high level of physical fitness. You get a really good workout as you are constantly using your energy to paddle 
                and catch waves. Experienced surfers are well turned fitness machines, having spent thousands of hours in the water.
                 Make sure you do not overdo it. When you are tired, you may not be able to stay afloat if you lose your surfboard.
                  When you start to get tired, go into shore, have a rest. Go back out when you are rested.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">7. Stay Cool.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">If you find yourself in areas where experienced surfers are heading straight towards you, keep calm. Experienced surfers will have seen you
                  and will adjust their line of surfing to go around you. Stay on your surfboard, do not panic or jump off your board.
                   To do so can result in the experienced surfer not being able to adjust their line at the last minute not to mention
                   being at risk from your loose surfboard.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">8. Surf Rage. </h5>
            <p class="text-break">Don’t be a part of it. Surfing is a sport that is in harmony with nature. Surf rage generally occurs when inexperienced surfers break the 
                surfing rules or panic and put other surfers at danger. So chill out, learn the rules and develop surf awareness 
                and have fun.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">9. Respect Experienced Surfers.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">Experienced surfers have a respect and understanding of the ocean developed over many hours of surfing. The goal is to surf good waves, 
                have fun and do it in a safe way. If a more experienced surfer than you offers you some advice, take heed. They could be offering you pearls of wisdom to help
                 you perfect your surfing or be helping to ensure you surf safely and not put yourself and others at risk.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">10. Be Surf Savvy.</h5>
            <p class="text-break">Knowing more about the sport will ensure you surf safely. Have lessons with an ASI Accredited Surf School, they can help with your surfing technique
                 and provide a range of safety information.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p class="text-break">Surfing is a great past-time that can be enjoyed by all. The more educated you are about the surfing, the more fun, easier to do, and safer it is</p>
